The **Chain Reaction Challenge (Rube Goldberg Machine)** is an excellent team-building activity, as it requires creativity, collaboration, and engineering skills while breaking down hierarchical barriers. Here's how to execute this activity effectively:

### 1. **Objective and Rules**
   - **Main Objective:** Teams will create a Rube Goldberg machine, a device that uses a series of chain reactions to perform a simple task (e.g., popping a balloon, ringing a bell, or knocking over an object).
   - **Time Limit:** Each team will have 60-90 minutes to design and build their machine.
   - **Success Criteria:** The machine must complete the task successfully. Points can be awarded for creativity, complexity, teamwork, and how seamlessly the chain reaction works.
   - **Bonus Criteria:** Teams can earn bonus points for incorporating unique or unexpected elements, or if their chain reaction takes a particularly long or complicated path to complete the task.

### 2. **Materials Required**
   You can source everyday objects from around the office or get some inexpensive supplies. Here's a list of possible items to include:
   - **Dominoes**
   - **Rubber bands**
   - **String**
   - **Toy cars**
   - **Marbles**
   - **Plastic tubes (for rolling objects)**
   - **Blocks or building bricks (e.g., Lego)**
   - **Cardboard**
   - **Paper cups**
   - **Scissors, tape, glue**
   - **Ping pong balls**
   - **Books (for ramps or barriers)**
   - **Paper clips**
   - **Small balls (tennis balls, foam balls)**
   - **Balloons (can be used as part of the chain or the final task)**
   - **Wooden sticks (e.g., popsicle sticks)**
   - **Bell or any small sound-making device (for the final task)**
   - **Small pulleys (optional but great for extra complexity)**

   You can also customize the materials based on what’s readily available.

### 3. **Execution Steps**
   
#### **Step 1: Introduction and Team Formation**
   - **Divide the participants** into small teams of 4-6 members, mixing MDs, VPs, and SEPs. Encourage diverse teams so that leadership barriers naturally dissolve as people collaborate.
   - **Explain the challenge:** Briefly explain what a Rube Goldberg machine is and show a short example video to inspire creativity and give context. Set clear rules for the challenge (e.g., time limits, what materials can be used, and how the task must be completed).

#### **Step 2: Define the Simple Task**
   - Choose a simple, fun task that the machine must perform, such as:
     - Ringing a bell
     - Popping a balloon
     - Knocking over a cup
     - Lighting a small LED light (if safe and available)
   
   Keep the task simple to allow for more creative and complex setups in the machine itself.

#### **Step 3: Design Phase**
   - **Allocate planning time (10-15 minutes):** Teams should brainstorm and sketch their ideas, focusing on how to make the task as intricate and entertaining as possible. Encourage teams to think outside the box and delegate tasks within the group (e.g., one person in charge of the first sequence, another for the middle part, etc.).
   - **Provide inspiration:** Give examples of chain reactions like a marble rolling down a ramp, knocking over dominoes that trigger a toy car to move, which then pulls on a string to pop a balloon.

#### **Step 4: Building Phase**
   - **Provide the materials:** Ensure that all teams have access to the materials listed. Let them work hands-on to bring their design to life.
   - **Encourage collaboration:** Make sure team members are communicating, testing out ideas, and adjusting their machines as needed. This is where leadership barriers naturally break down—team members will need to rely on each other’s input and skills to succeed.

#### **Step 5: Testing Phase**
   - **Allow multiple test runs:** Teams should have time to test and tweak their machines. The goal is to get the chain reaction working perfectly from start to finish. Encourage them to experiment with different configurations if something doesn’t work as planned.
   - **Provide facilitators:** Have facilitators or mentors (if available) to check on progress, provide gentle guidance, and ensure teams stay on track.

#### **Step 6: Presentation and Judging**
   - **Each team presents** their machine to the group. Teams should explain the rationale behind their design and walk through how the machine works.
   - **Judging criteria:** You can assign points based on:
     - **Creativity and complexity:** How intricate is the machine?
     - **Teamwork:** How well did the team work together?
     - **Functionality:** Did the machine successfully complete the task?
     - **Bonus points** for humor, creativity, and innovation (e.g., unexpected chain reactions, using office supplies in quirky ways).
   - **Celebrate** success with a small prize or recognition for the winning team.

### 4. **Expected Outcomes**
   - **Breaking Leadership Barriers:** This activity levels the playing field because creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration are more important than titles. Senior leaders and SEPs will be working together as equals to complete the challenge.
   - **Promotes Experimentation:** The freedom to fail fast and try new configurations closely aligns with the startup-like culture of SEP PROPEL, encouraging innovation and adaptability.
   - **Fostering Team Spirit:** The challenge requires teams to listen to each other, respect all contributions, and work cohesively under time constraints, fostering a sense of camaraderie and mutual respect.

### 5. **Variations**
   - **Themed Machines:** You could add a theme to the machines, such as “environmentally friendly,” where the machine must incorporate eco-friendly elements or demonstrate a concept related to sustainability.
   - **Time-Based Bonus:** Teams that complete their machine within a shorter time period could be awarded bonus points.

This activity will not only be fun but also simulate real-world collaboration, where different levels of the organization come together to solve complex problems.
