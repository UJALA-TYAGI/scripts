U - Good morning, everyone!I know what you’re thinking. ‘Why is there a random chair sitting on this stage Looking all dramatic under the spotlight?’I promise—it’s not just here for the aesthetics.It looks like Just an ordinary chair, right? Nothing fancy. Four legs, a seat, a backrest— It’s empty, plain, and honestly… kind of boring - end of story. Or is it? 
But what if I told you this chair has a story? That every time someone sits here, it’s transformed—not by the chair itself obviously, but by the person who fills it.

 U - This chair has seen things. Big things.
Every time someone sat here, they left behind something special, A STORY. Maybe it was about a bold risk, a surprising success, or even a stumble that taught them something amazing.

 U - Now, picture yourself in this chair. What would your story be? Would it be about that one audacious moment when you said, "Why not me?" and took a leap no one saw coming? Or maybe it’s about the quiet grind—the late nights, the small wins, the relentless pursuit of something bigger. 
 Here’s  the thing, This chair isn’t picky. It doesn’t care who you are, where you’re from, or whether you’re a risk-taker or a planner. It’s just waiting for someone bold enough to sit down and start something.It will not ask you where you’ve been or what’s happened before. It’s only interested in one question: What will you do next?

U - With that, we welcome you to SEPX.
