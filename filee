1. Transformers
* Paper: Attention is All You Need (Google, 2017)
* Problem Solved: RNNs/LSTMs process sequentially → slow, long-range dependencies lost
* Key Concepts:
    * Parallelism: process all tokens simultaneously
    * Attention: each token attends to every other token
    * Self-Attention: token attends to itself + others (context preservation)
    * Q/K/V vectors: Query, Key, Value → weighted sum per token
    * Multi-Head Attention: captures multiple relationships in parallel
* Use: Foundation of LLMs (GPT, BERT, etc.)

2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Purpose: Improve LLM output by grounding in external data
* Pipeline:
    1. Split documents → chunks
    2. Convert chunks → embeddings, store in vector DB
    3. Query → embedding → semantic search
    4. Retrieve top-k relevant chunks
    5. Provide query + chunks as prompt → LLM generates grounded output
* Failure Modes & Mitigations:
    * Poor chunking → context mismatch → fix via overlapping chunking
    * Irrelevant retrieval → reranking / hybrid search
    * Stale data → fresh ingestion pipeline
    * Long documents → summarize chunks
    * Residual hallucinations → attribution / verification

3. Agents
* Definition: LLM + tools → decides which tool(s) to call
* Tool Metadata: name, description, input/output, constraints
* Types of Agents: single-tool, multi-tool, reactive/reflex, hierarchical

4. Tool Selection
* Primary Signal: tool metadata & description
* Other Reasoning:
    * Semantic matching between query & tool purpose
    * Context & prompt design
    * Previous actions / intermediate outputs (ReAct loop)
    * Relevance score: embedding similarity → filter top-k tools
    * LLM internal confidence / probability

5. Orchestration Patterns
Pattern	Description	Pros	Cons	Use Case
Plan-and-Execute	LLM plans full sequence → executes sequentially	Fewer LLM calls, predictable	Less adaptive if intermediate results change	Multi-step tasks with predictable steps
ReAct (Reason + Act)	Loop: Think → Act → Observe → Repeat	Adaptive, handles uncertainty	More LLM calls, higher latency	Multi-tool, dynamic tasks
Reflex / Reactive	Immediate response to input	Very fast	Cannot handle multi-step reasoning	Simple queries or single-tool tasks
Hierarchical / Multi-Level	Break tasks into sub-goals → sub-agents handle them	Modular, reusable	Complex orchestration	Complex workflows or multi-step pipelines
Loop + Planner Hybrid	Partial plan → execute → re-plan based on results	Adaptive + fewer calls than full ReAct	Slightly complex	Tasks needing adaptability but efficiency
Goal-Driven / Constraint-Based	Actions selected based on constraints/goals	Guarantees constraints	Solving constraints may be slow	Enterprise rules, cost-aware tasks
Reactive-Deliberative Hybrid	Mix of reactive + planning layers	Balances speed & reasoning	More complex	Real-time systems with mixed requirements
6. Multi-Tool Agent System Design
Layers:
1. Tool Layer: RAG retriever, API caller, code interpreter; metadata standardized
2. Agent / Orchestration Layer: LLM
    * ReAct or Plan-and-Execute
    * Loop reasoning + action
    * Tool chaining
    * Optimizations: loop limits, caching, parallelization, early stopping
3. Execution Layer: executes tools, collects outputs, feeds back to LLM
Data Flow Example:
User Query
      |
      v
LLM Agent (ReAct/Plan)
      |
      +--------+---------+---------+
      |        |         |         |
    RAG      API      Code Interpreter
      |        |         |
      +--------+---------+
               |
         Collect Outputs
               |
               v
        LLM Final Output
               |
               v
         User Response

7. Latency & Optimization
* Loop constraints / iteration limits
* Tool pre-selection / relevance filtering
* Parallel execution of independent tools
* Caching previous outputs
* Early stopping
* Concise structured prompts

8. Evaluation Metrics
* RAG: hit@k, relevance, faithfulness, F1/precision
* Multi-tool agents: tool selection accuracy, success rate, hallucination rate

9. Prompt Engineering & Reasoning Techniques
* Zero-Shot: LLM performs task without examples; relies purely on instructions in prompt
* Few-Shot: LLM performs task after seeing a few input-output examples
* Chain-of-Thought (CoT): LLM is prompted to reason step by step, improving multi-step or complex reasoning

10. Additional Concepts
* Memory / long-term context in agents
* Embeddings: dense vector representation of text for similarity/search
* Top-k retrieval: retrieve most relevant k results from vector DB
* LLM hallucinations: when LLM generates plausible but incorrect info; mitigated via grounding (RAG)
* Framework Awareness: LangChain, LlamaIndex, HuggingFace Agents
