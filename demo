[Slide 1: Why We’re Here] Hi everyone, and thank you for joining.
We’re here to take you through something we’ve built during the hackathon as part of Innovation Week. The core idea came from a very simple thought — we talk a lot about feedback and listening, but how do we make that process smarter, scalable, and genuinely impactful?

[Slide 2: Meet the Team]
 Before I jump in — we’re Flamingos on Trampoline, a team of SEP analysts from across Infrastructure Platforms. Interestingly, we hadn’t worked together before this event. Coming from different LOBs, different day-to-day roles, we brought varied perspectives and skillsets — which ended up being one of the biggest strengths of this project.


[Slide 3: "Complete the Survey Today"] Let me start with something familiar.
We've all received surveys — after an event, a training, maybe a new product launch. And let’s be honest, at some point, most of us have either skipped it or filled it out half-heartedly.
The reasons? Static questions. One-size-fits-all templates. Sometimes the questions aren’t even relevant. And the bigger problem — we don’t really know what happens to that feedback.
Traditional survey methods just don’t reflect how dynamic our workplace is today.


[Slide 4: Listening Strategy]
 That’s where the Listening Strategy comes in — a structured approach built by the CTO COS, Tech Center Leadership, and volunteers. The idea is to gather feedback in a way that’s meaningful — not just collecting data, but identifying cultural gaps, aligning with strategy, and capturing diverse perspectives to drive continuous improvement.
Each Listening Strategy involves roles like Tech Center Managers, UX Researchers, Data Analysts, and volunteers. But getting people to show up for conversations, organizing sessions, and manually analyzing data — it’s a lot.
And that’s where we saw an opportunity.


[Slide 5: Introducing Flamingo]
 We built Flamingo — an AI-powered agent to support and scale the Listening Strategy.
Flamingo can initiate feedback conversations, schedule sessions, tailor questions based on context, and even generate insights — all while ensuring compliance and maintaining the spirit of a two-way dialogue.


[Slide 6: Key Capabilities (Talk through highlights only)] Just to touch on a few features:
* Admin dashboard for initiating and managing conversations - This is where everything starts, here they can define the audience, and set the tone.
* Flamingo AI Agent- At the heart of it is the AI agent — built on GPT-4o — that interacts in a human-like, empathetic way. It doesn’t feel like a form — it feels like a conversation.
* After each interaction, Flamingo provides summaries, key takeaways, and action items. So instead of just raw data, stakeholders get decision-ready insights.
* Custom templates and persona-based question flows, Device-agnostic, and built to scale across use cases - Whether it's about an event, a product release, or a recurring process — Flamingo adapts its questions to context and user role. Townhalls, product launches, internal tools — admins can pick or build templates that fit. No need to start from scratch.
* Scalable & Integrated with other products like swipe, digital assiatant and other  And we’ve already seen traction — (point of you)PoY and the JPMC Feedback Portal teams reached out to us for potential collaboration. 
What we’ve built isn’t a survey tool — it’s a listening platform.


 You’ll walk through this, but just to say — this is not a prototype on slides. What you’ll see is what we built — in two days — with real conversations, real data handling, and real insight generation.

[Slide 9: What’s Next] Looking ahead, we’re exploring:
* We’re working on building evaluations into the system — so the agent can analyze sentiment, flag risks, and learn over time.
* Persona identification is another key area — say for something like a Townhall, instead of reaching out to everyone, Flamingo could intelligently identify and engage only the most relevant audience.
* Audio interaction -this is yet to be decided -  allowing the agent to have a voice-based conversation with the user persona instead of relying on text. 
* We’re also exploring ways to recognize and appreciate employees who consistently participate in feedback conversations.
* Through potential integration with the go/appreciate , we could send a thank-you eCard to those who share insights — turning feedback into a two-way exchange. - this is again to be decided
* 
All of this is in motion — I would say in these 2 days The foundation is in place — what’s exciting now is how far we can scale this, and how deeply it can integrate across our existing ecosystem.

As I have mentioned already - Flamingo isn’t tied to one product or function. It’s agnostic — both technically and from a business lens. Anywhere feedback matters — it can plug in.

We’ve had great support from Tech Center managers while building this. That, for us, was an early validation that this isn’t just an Innovation Week project — it has practical potential.


[Final Slide: Closing Ask (Subtle Ask)] For us, this experience has been incredibly rewarding. We stepped away from our regular BAU work, picked up new skills — from ReactJS to PyNeta and prompt engineering — and collaborated across functions.
We’d love to hear your thoughts on where Flamingo could be valuable. Whether it’s a product, a service, or a process — if there’s a space where listening better could make things better, we’d be excited to explore that.
Thank you again for your time — and we’re happy to take any feedback.
