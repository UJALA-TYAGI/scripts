Can Assistive Technology Foster Inclusivity for People with Disabilities ? 

True empowerment for specially-abled individuals lies in acknowledging their rights and building a world where accessibility and inclusion are the norm. 

Persons with disabilities face extreme isolation, exclusion and daunting challenges like social stigma, lack of opportunities for employment, and are subjected to various barriers. In the U.S., the 2020 employment rate for persons with disabilities was just 17.9%, compared to 61.8% for those without disabilities. 

Assistive Technology (AT) plays a pivotal role in empowering the specially abled by presenting opportunities for them to meaningfully participate in society.  AT is used as an umbrella term for both assistive products and related services. It is defined as “any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is used to increase, maintain or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities

The world, today, recognizes the increasing importance of assistive technology (AT) that can reduce the functional limitations of persons with disabilities. 

There are 21 disabilities that have been identified under the RPWD (The Rights of Persons with Disabilities)Act 2016 of India.
But we will discuss visual impairment, hearing and communication disability.


Here I have highlighted some benefits of Assistive Technology, but the benefits of AT are not limited to just these pointers.
AT is more than just a tool; it's a gateway to equal opportunities and active participation. By making assistive devices affordable and accessible, we empower PWDs to live independently and boost their self-esteem. The right technology not only enhances their ability to function but also enables them to contribute meaningfully to society, enriching our communities with their unique talents and perspectives.

Lets look at the AT Devices available for Persons With Visual Impairment 
 
Braille
Braille is a tactile code used by persons with visual impairment to read and write in any language,
Braille devices allows persons with visual impairment to read and produce content in Braille.
 
Electronic magnifiers
Electronic magnifiers capture images with a camera, enlarge them on a screen and enhance the visibility. This helps persons with low vision read text.

Some magnifiers may include additional features, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which scans printed words and reads the text aloud.
 
Screen readers
Screen readers are software that convert the text on a screen into Braille or synthetic speech. Screen readers are particularly helpful to persons with visual impairment who do not know Braille.

There are two major screen readers for computers: an open source software called NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) and a paid software called Job Access With Speech (JAWS).
Smart phones generally consist accessibility features which includes screen reader such as TalkBack on Android and VoiceOver on iOS. 
White canes
White canes allow persons with visual impairment to travel independently. 

We have canes that are designed to robe obstacles to provide information on the path ahead, inform the public that the user has visual impairment, some are designed for more stability to aid the user in walking.

* Long canes which are used to slide on the ground and probe obstacles to provide information on the path ahead.
* Identification (ID) canes can also be used to probe ahead, but its main purpose is to inform the public that the user has visual impairment
* Support canes are similar to ID canes but are designed more for stability to aid the user in walking



Persons With Hearing Impairment USE ALDs
* Assistive listening devices (ALDs) help amplify the sounds you want to hear, especially where there’s a lot of background noise. ALDs can be used with a hearing aid or cochlear implant to help a wearer hear certain sounds better.

* Alerting devices connect to a doorbell, telephone, or alarm that emits a loud sound or blinking light to let someone with hearing loss know that an event is taking place.

ALDs
Audio induction or hearing loop
Loops work by eliminating background noise, allowing the listener to hear the speaker's voice clearly, at a comfortable listening level. It transmits sound via a microphone. It can also be used at counters and other smaller spaces to improve one-on-one communication.


* Transmits sound via a microphone, an amplifier and wiring that encircles the seating (or listening!) area. It can also be used at counters and other smaller spaces to improve one-on-one communication.
* Loops work by eliminating background noise, allowing the listener to hear the speaker's voice clearly, at a comfortable listening level. This is especially helpful in large spaces with poor acoustic features, such as hard floors, high ceilings and open space, but it is also helpful in settings where many people may be speaking at once, like an airport check-in desk or a bank.  
* To pick up the signals, hearing aid users use the T (telecoil) switch or program on their hearing aids and sit or stand within or near the wired area. However, even individuals without hearing aids or without a telecoil program can benefit from loop systems by using a portable device with headphones.
* You can learn more about hearing loops and advocating for loop installation at Loop Minnesota.


FM system
* Transmits sound wirelessly via radio waves. Commonly used for group meetings, conferences and classes. 

* The speaker wears a compact transmitter and microphone and the listener wears a portable receiver.
* The receiver may have a headphone, neckloop or other accessories.
* Commonly used for group meetings, church settings, conferences and classes. It may be used both indoors and outdoors.


Infrared system
* Transmits sound wirelessly via invisible light beams. Commonly used in churches, theaters and auditoriums. It can only be used indoors.

* The receiver must be in direct line of sight of the light beam from the transmitter.
* Commonly used in churches, theaters and auditoriums. It can only be used indoors; sunlight may interfere with transmission.
* There are infrared devices made just for home television listening. The transmitter is placed on the TV and plugs into an electrical outlet. The user wears a battery-powered headset (receiver) with volume control. The TV volume can then be set at a comfortable level for other listeners.
* 

Personal amplified system
* A portable device that transmits sound via a microphone and transmitter to headphones, an earphone or a neck loop.
* Useful for one-on-one conversations or TV listening.
* Can be used indoors or outdoors.


Bluetooth system
* Transmits sound via Wi-Fi.
* Works directly with hearing aids that have Bluetooth.
* Individuals with hearing loss who do not use hearing aids can use a smartphone or tablet with earphones to connect to the wirelessly transmitted sound.



Assistive Technology Devices for Persons With Speech Impairment 

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices help people with communication disorders to express themselves. These devices can range from a simple picture board to a computer program that synthesizes speech from text.


The simplest AAC device is a picture board or touch screen that uses pictures or symbols of typical items and activities that make up a person’s daily life. For example, a person might touch the image of a glass to ask for a drink. 
Some devices employ a text display. The display panel typically faces outward so that two people can exchange information while facing each other. 
Speech-generating devices go one step further by translating words or pictures into speech. 
Some devices employ a vocabulary of prerecorded words while others have an unlimited vocabulary, synthesizing speech as words are typed in. Software programs that convert personal computers into speaking devices are also available.


The path to AT is not easy, we have certain Barriers with Assistive Technology:
1. **Low Awareness**: Lack of knowledge about available assistive technologies.
2. **High Costs**: Expensive devices and solutions.
3. **Limited Physical Access**: Difficulty in reaching service providers or locations where assistive technologies are available.
4. **Inadequate Product Range**: Limited variety of products to meet diverse needs.
5. **Procurement Challenges**: Difficulties in acquiring necessary equipment.
6. **Workforce Capacity Gaps**: Insufficient trained professionals to provide support and services.
7. **Inadequate Policy**: Lack of supportive laws and regulations.
8. **Insufficient Funding**: Not enough financial support for individuals or organizations.
9. **Assistive Technology Sector Fragmentation**: Lack of coordination among stakeholders and service providers.
10. **Sociodemographic Obstacles**: Barriers related to age, gender, socioeconomic status, or cultural factors.


As I conclude, I would like to share a personal story  I have a colleague who faces challenges in hearing and speaking, but these challenges have never diminished his motivation or commitment to excellence. Despite the obstacles, he actively leads numerous initiatives within our firm to promote inclusivity for people with disabilities.

What truly inspires me is his unwavering dedication to creating a more inclusive environment.He's even taken the time to offer to teach me sign language, opening a new world of communication and connection for both of us.

This experience has made me realize that inclusivity isn't just a goal—it's a journey that requires all of us to participate. It's about recognizing the unique contributions that each person can make, regardless of the challenges they face. As we continue to leverage assistive technology, we not only support our colleagues but also enrich our own lives by embracing the diverse perspectives they bring.

His story is a powerful reminder that when we invest in inclusivity, we're not just helping others; we're building a stronger, more compassionate community. Let's continue to work towards a future where everyone has the tools and support they need to thrive."
