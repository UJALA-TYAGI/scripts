Absolutely — here’s a **fresh, rephrased version** of your **demo script**, keeping your core content, structure, and message intact, but **rewritten entirely** so it sounds **new, more natural, and unscripted** for today’s presentation.

It still sounds professional, but with a **slightly more conversational tone**, so it doesn’t feel memorized or copy-pasted — and it’ll land well with a leadership audience who may have seen your previous talk.

### 🔹 Refreshed Demo Speech for Today's Meeting

---

**\[Slide 1: Why We’re Here]**
Hi everyone, thanks for making the time.
We’re here to walk you through something we’ve been working on as part of the hackathon during Innovation Week.
The idea we started with was pretty simple — we wanted to make the way we gather and use feedback smarter, faster, and more meaningful.

---

**\[Slide 2: Team Introduction]**
We’re *Flamingos on Trampoline*, a team of SEP analysts from across IP.
Interestingly, none of us had worked together before this — we’re from different lines of business, doing very different day-to-day work. But that mix really shaped the way we thought about the problem and the solution.
We also stepped beyond our usual stacks and picked up new tech along the way — PyNeta, ReactJS, prompt engineering — and that made the journey even more fun and rewarding.

---

**\[Slide 3: “Complete the Survey Today”]**
Let’s take a moment to talk about something we’ve all seen before — the follow-up survey.

After every event, session, or release, we’re sent a form — usually with fixed questions, dropdowns, and maybe a text box.
More often than not, we either skip it, fill it out in a hurry, or wonder whether the input we give actually goes anywhere.

That’s not because feedback isn’t important — it’s because the tools we use to collect it haven’t kept up with how we work today.

---

**\[Slide 4: Listening Strategy]**
Within the firm, there’s already a strong foundation for thoughtful feedback — and that’s the **Listening Strategy**.

It was designed by the CTO COS, Tech Center leadership, and volunteers to bring structure and depth to feedback — aligning it to strategy, identifying culture gaps, and driving actual change.

But running a listening round — from scheduling to analysis — is time-intensive. It relies on volunteers and a lot of manual effort.
That’s where we saw an opportunity to simplify and scale.

---

**\[Slide 5: Enter Flamingo]**
We built **Flamingo**, an AI-powered assistant that helps teams execute the Listening Strategy at scale — while keeping the human side of feedback intact.

It can initiate conversations, guide users through relevant questions, and generate summaries and insights — all while respecting privacy, context, and intent.

---

**\[Slide 6: Highlights – Key Capabilities]**
A few highlights:

* There’s an **admin dashboard** that makes it easy to launch and manage listening sessions — define your audience, set objectives, and track progress.

* The core of it is the **Flamingo Agent** — built on GPT-4o — which makes the experience feel like a dialogue, not a form. It listens, responds, and adjusts based on the user.

* The **insight engine** is where the value really comes in — it delivers takeaways, action items, and themes, not just raw data.

* You can also **customize flows** based on use case — townhalls, product feedback, internal tool launches — and define how Flamingo sounds, who it talks to, and what it focuses on.

* It’s **device-agnostic** and **integration-ready** — built to connect with tools like Swipey, Digital Assistant, and more.

And we’re excited to share that **PoY and the JPMC Feedback Portal team** reached out to us after seeing the project — they're exploring how this could support their work.

---

**\[Slide 7: What We Built]**
You’ll walk through the product in a bit — but just to be clear, what you’ll see isn’t a concept deck.
This is a working solution, built in 48 hours, with real data handling, real flows, and a functioning AI agent.

---

**\[Slide 8: What’s Next]**
There’s a lot of potential ahead, and we’ve started exploring a few directions:

* **Evaluations** — so Flamingo can assess sentiment, identify red flags, and evolve its recommendations over time.

* **Persona targeting** — let’s say there’s a Townhall that’s only relevant to a specific function; Flamingo could ensure only that group is engaged, keeping feedback relevant and focused.

* **Audio-based interaction** *(TBD)* — we’re also thinking about enabling voice conversations with the agent, to make it more accessible and conversational in the future.

* **Recognition & appreciation** *(also under consideration)* — through a possible link with **go/appreciate**, we’d love to recognize employees who consistently share meaningful feedback by sending a simple eCard. It’s a small step toward building a culture of listening and response.

All of this is still evolving — but what’s exciting is how much ground we’ve already covered in just two days.
The foundation is there, and there’s so much more we can do.

---

**\[Slide 9: Final Thoughts]**
The key thing is — Flamingo isn’t built for one use case.
It’s **agnostic**, both in terms of technology and business application. Wherever there’s a need for honest feedback — product, platform, or service — Flamingo can plug in.

We were fortunate to have the backing of **Tech Center managers** during development — which gave us the confidence that this idea isn’t just viable, but relevant.

---

**\[Closing Ask – Light & Open-Ended]**
This experience has been incredibly fulfilling — not just because of what we built, but how we built it.

We’d love to hear your thoughts on where Flamingo could be useful. If you think there’s a space in your team, product, or process where smarter listening could help — we’d be more than happy to explore that with you.

Thanks again for your time — we’re looking forward to your feedback.

* a 1-minute quick version of this for a leadership roundtable
* or a punchy one-liner to wrap it up confidently
