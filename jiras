**Background:**
To improve isolation, scalability, and environment management, we plan to run the Atlas Naming service inside virtual clusters (vClusters) instead of directly on shared Kubernetes namespaces.

**What I want to do:**
Deploy the Naming service into vClusters, set up necessary configs (like ingress, secrets, and service discovery), and validate its functionality via E2E tests against the vCluster endpoints.

**What it achieves:**
This enables better test environment isolation, reduces risk of conflicts across teams, and aligns with the orgâ€™s direction toward ephemeral and sandboxed infra environments.
