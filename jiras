**Background:**
We have an existing E2E test suite for the Atlas Naming service, which runs feature-based scenarios and validates API behavior. A new GJRN host has been introduced that serves the same endpoints and responses as the Naming host, requiring test coverage without duplicating scenarios.

**What I want to do:**
Extend the current E2E test logic to run the same scenario steps against both the Naming and GJRN hosts, by internally routing requests to both and comparing their responses.

**What it achieves:**
This approach ensures shared test coverage across both hosts with minimal overhead, enables early detection of discrepancies between Naming and GJRN responses, and maintains a unified, readable Cucumber test report.
