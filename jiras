### **Background**

Our customers interact with internal AWS boundaries (e.g., Portfolio, Workload, Network Boundaries) via Kubernetes APIs. Until now, there hasnâ€™t been a centralized, user-friendly reference explaining how to make these API calls.

### **Objective**

Create a detailed Kubernetes API reference document outlining all supported operations (GET, POST, PATCH, etc.) for boundary resources, including URL formats, headers, payload structures, and expected responses.

### **What this achieves**

Helps customers easily understand and correctly use Kubernetes APIs to manage boundary resources, reducing onboarding time and minimizing errors during integration.
