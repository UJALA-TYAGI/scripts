**Subject:** Innovation Week | Bengaluru Tech Center Hackathon Runner-Up – *Flamingos on Trampoline* (Infrastructure Platforms)

Dear MDs,

We’re excited to share that our team, *Flamingos on Trampoline*, secured the **2nd position at the Bengaluru Tech Center** in this year’s Innovation Week Global Hackathon—among **431 projects and over 2500 participants** across the firm.

Our project, *AI for Listening Strategy Management*, leverages AI to transform how we gather, process, and act on feedback across our Global Tech Centers. It automates audience selection, meeting scheduling, notifications, conversation capture, and reporting—bringing **efficiency, consistency, and scale** to the firm’s Listening Strategy, all while maintaining compliance and data integrity.

The solution is designed not just for event-based feedback but as a **modular, plug-and-play framework** that can be integrated with **any tech product or service offering** across the firm. Within the IP ecosystem, we see exciting opportunities to integrate with platforms like **Atlas 2.0, Kickstart, AHEAD, ICE, Digital SCM, DCOS, and the ITSM Analyzer**—helping capture honest, actionable insights to continuously improve user experience and service quality.

As a group of Software Engineering Program (SEP) analysts from diverse teams within Infrastructure Platforms, this experience has been incredibly fulfilling. We stepped beyond our BAU roles and upskilled ourselves in **ReactJS, PyNeta, and Prompt Engineering**, while learning to work in a fast-paced, cross-functional environment. Most importantly, we had a lot of fun building something that could genuinely add value across LOBs.

We’re proud of our journey, and even more excited about the potential this solution holds for IP and the firm as a whole.

Thank you for cultivating a culture of innovation and giving us a platform to explore ideas with real impact.

Warm regards,
**\[Your Full Name]**
