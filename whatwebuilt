[Opening – Greeting & Gratitude]**
Hi everyone — thanks so much for taking the time to join today’s discussion.
We’re really excited to be here and explore how we might be able to integrate what we’ve built with the work your team is doing.

**\[What We Built – Short Context]**
Just to quickly set the context — during Innovation Week, we built a solution called **Flamingo**.
It’s an AI-powered platform designed to make our **Listening Strategy** smarter, scalable, and easier to execute.

The idea came from a simple challenge we’ve all seen — feedback collection tends to be manual, repetitive, and often limited in how much insight it can actually surface.
So, we asked: *What if gathering feedback felt more like a conversation — and less like a form?*

Flamingo does exactly that — it’s a conversational AI agent that interacts with users, tailors its questions based on context, and generates actionable insights — all while being lightweight, customizable, and built to scale across products and teams.

**\[Why We Built It – Problem Framing]**
The current Listening Strategy is powerful — but running it requires a lot of time, people, and coordination: scheduling sessions, recruiting volunteers, manually analyzing feedback, and so on.

We wanted to build something that could support this effort — not replace the human touch, but **augment it** using AI.

In just two days, we delivered a working solution with real interactions, summaries, and a modular design that’s both **LOB-agnostic** and **tech-ready**.

**\[Why This Meeting – Integration Ask]**
The reason we’re here today is that we believe there’s strong potential for **Flamingo to integrate with your product** — whether it’s to enhance feedback loops, improve user engagement, or gather insight post-launch or post-interaction.

We’re not thinking of this as a standalone tool — our goal is to embed this kind of listening intelligence wherever it’s needed, and make it seamless within existing systems.

We’d love to walk you through what Flamingo can do, and more importantly, understand your product goals — so we can identify if and how this integration could bring value to your users and roadmap.

**\[Smooth Transition to Demo or Conversation]**
I’ll take just a few minutes to show you what Flamingo looks like in action — and then we’d love to open it up for your thoughts, ideas, or even challenges you face where a tool like this might fit in.

Let’s dive in.

The Listening Strategy is an initiative driven by the CTO COS, Tech Center Leadership, and research volunteers.
Its goal is to create a structured, intentional way of gathering feedback — not just through generic surveys, but through meaningful, data-driven conversations with employees and partners.
