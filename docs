Can Assistive Technology Foster Inclusivity for People with Disabilities ? OR The Role of Assistive Technology in Fostering Inclusivity for People with Disabilities.

True empowerment for specially-abled individuals lies in acknowledging their rights and building a world where accessibility and inclusion are the norm. Assistive Technology (AT) plays a pivotal role in empowering the specially abled by presenting opportunities for them to meaningfully participate in society. Technology has become the leading factor in education, economic activities, and innovation, the substantial progress made in the development of AT has significantly benefitted individuals with disabilities. 
Â 
This paper will discuss how AT can reduce inequalities, advance inclusivity, assist all differently abled individuals to lead healthy, prolific, self-reliant, and dignified lives. We will review the existing as well as emerging ATs, and explore how access to AT can be improved by examining different initiatives and their gaps.
