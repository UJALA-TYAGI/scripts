If I stay in the same team but contribute to another, how will my time be divided and managed?

  How will my performance be evaluated during and after the transition?

  Is there a mentorship or buddy system in place to help me adjust to the new team and environment?
  
  Will there be regular check-ins to discuss my progress and well-being during the transition?

  Are there plans to minimize further transitions to help stabilize my role and responsibilities?

  If I encounter difficulties or feel overwhelmed during the transition, what is the best way to raise these concerns and seek help?

  Can I provide feedback on the transition process to help improve it for others in the future?
