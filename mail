Subject: Mid-Year Check-In Follow-Up: Request for Feedback and Ratings

Hi,

I hope you're doing well!

I wanted to reach out regarding my mid-year check-in. I've put in my reflections and goals, and as a next step, I’d really appreciate it if you could share your perspective in the form of indicative ratings across our three firm pillars — Leadership, Client & Stakeholder Engagement, and BAU Delivery.

I completely understand that mid-year ratings are not a formal part of our review process, but having your input at this stage would be extremely valuable for me. It’ll help me better understand where I currently stand, identify areas of strength and opportunities to improve, and ultimately stay aligned with expectations for the rest of the year.

It would be great if you could reply to this email whenever you get a chance with your views. I’ll also bring this up briefly on our next catch-up so we can align on any feedback you might want to share verbally as well.

Thanks so much in advance!



Thanks! Here's the **complete write-up for Goal 1**, integrating your **Objectives and Action Steps** at the top, followed by the **refined accomplishments** we prepared earlier — all formatted cleanly for a single-sheet entry:

### **Summary of Alignment and Achievements**

Over the past months, I have consistently worked towards creating a more inclusive, engaging, and growth-oriented environment for peers and new joiners across the Bengaluru Tech Center. Key initiatives include:

* **Spoke at the Tech Center Overview Session**, representing the DE\&I workstream to over 200+ new joiners. I highlighted programs like *Proud to Be* and *Canvas*, reinforcing the firm's culture of inclusion and belonging.

* **Coordinated and led employee engagement during International Dance Day**, encouraging cross-LOB participation and cultural expression, aligning with the firm's community-building and wellbeing values.

* **Honored with the Extreme Volunteer Award for six consecutive quarters**, recognizing consistent contributions across *all six* Bengaluru Tech Center workstreams, including DE\&I, Innovation, Social & Cultural, and Community Engagement.
