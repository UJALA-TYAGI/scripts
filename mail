Subject: Reflections from LEAP Cohort 1
Hi [Manager’s Name],
I wanted to take a moment to share some reflections and key learnings from my experience as part of the LEAP Cohort 1 India Core Team:
* 🛠️ Content Ownership: I was responsible for curating and building end-to-end content for the entire cohort—across sessions, communications, and experiences. This helped me strengthen my storytelling, design thinking, and content strategy skills.
* 🎤 Final Day MC: I had the opportunity to host the final presentation day. It was a privilege to represent the program, connect with the audience, and ensure the day ended on a high note.
* 🤝 Cross-functional Collaboration: Worked closely with various stakeholders—speakers, panelists, and tech center leaders—to ensure a seamless learning experience for the participants.
* 🌱 Personal Growth:
    * Learned to manage high-visibility responsibilities with tight timelines.
    * Gained deeper insight into leadership behaviors and how programs like LEAP shape the culture of the firm.
    * Sharpened my ability to communicate with clarity and confidence, both on and off stage.
* 💡 Biggest Takeaway: The power of creating spaces for others to grow. Watching 7 incredible teams present bold ideas reminded me how impactful the right platform can be.
* 👏 Team Recognition: My teammate Aman Tayal was also part of one of the teams in LEAP. His team worked on Active Directory Hygiene—an innovative problem statement that was lauded by all the panelists for its creative approach.
Sharing one picture with the entire cohort and one with the core team—grateful to have been a part of such an energizing journey.
Thank you for your constant support and for giving me the space to lead and contribute meaningfully. I’m excited to take these learnings into my future work and continue building initiatives that matter.
Warm regards,
Ujala Tyagi
