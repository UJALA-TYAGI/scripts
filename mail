Subject: Mid-Year Check-In Follow-Up: Request for Feedback and Ratings

Hi,

I hope you're doing well!

I wanted to reach out regarding my mid-year check-in. I've put in my reflections and goals, and as a next step, I’d really appreciate it if you could share your perspective in the form of indicative ratings across our three firm pillars — Leadership, Client & Stakeholder Engagement, and BAU Delivery.

I completely understand that mid-year ratings are not a formal part of our review process, but having your input at this stage would be extremely valuable for me. It’ll help me better understand where I currently stand, identify areas of strength and opportunities to improve, and ultimately stay aligned with expectations for the rest of the year.

It would be great if you could reply to this email whenever you get a chance with your views. I’ll also bring this up briefly on our next catch-up so we can align on any feedback you might want to share verbally as well.

Thanks so much in advance!
