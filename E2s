I hope this message finds you well. We are thrilled to introduce you to SEP PROPEL, an innovative three-month program designed to empower our high-performing Software Engineering Professionals (SEPs) with opportunities to work on cutting-edge revolutionary technologies, driving the business needs of our firm. 

### About SEP PROPEL

SEP PROPEL is a unique initiative aimed at fostering a startup-like culture within our organization. This program encourages SEPs to embrace fast-paced learning and experimentation, including the freedom to fail fast. Participants will have end-to-end responsibility for projects, from inception through production to final client delivery. 

The objectives of SEP PROPEL are straightforward:
- **Upskill SEPs**: Provide opportunities to work on next-gen revolutionary technologies, empowering SEPs to enhance their skill set.
- **Bridge the Gap**: Align the needs of the business with the untapped potential of eager SEPs, ready to tackle cutting-edge futuristic technologies.
- **Develop Talent**: Encourage internal mobility, increase networking, spread technical awareness, and provide a platform for innovative business problems that leverage the skills of our junior talent.

### Roles and Responsibilities in SEP PROPEL

To ensure the success of SEP PROPEL, we have outlined specific roles:

1. **Problem Owner**: Holds the problem statement and vision, providing technical resources.

3. **Volunteers**: Act as scrum masters, tracking the progress of the project.

### The Role of Expert Engineers (E2s)

We believe that the expertise and excellence of our E2 community are crucial for the success of SEP PROPEL. E2s are high-performing, high-potential employees who have undergone a rigorous eight-month program to enhance their technical and soft skills. Your experience and knowledge uniquely position you to guide our SEPs through this journey.

#### Key Responsibilities of E2s in SEP PROPEL:
- **Liaison with the Client and Core Team**: Establish and maintain a connection with the client SPOC and develop an implementation plan for the project.

### Why We Need E2s

Your excellence, honed through rigorous training and hands-on experience, is precisely why we need E2s for SEP PROPEL. The problem statements in SEP PROPEL are similar to the Quests in the E2 program. Your insights and guidance will help SEPs navigate challenges you have previously encountered, fostering a dynamic learning environment and shaping them into future E2s poised to drive innovation and success within our firm.
