If you prefer to avoid using a ConfigMap and want the job to directly pick up policies and test cases from specific directories, you can achieve this by mounting the directories containing your policies and test cases into the job's container. Here's how to set it up:

---

### Folder Structure
```
/your-application/
  /policies/
    policy1.yaml
    policy2.yaml
  /tests/
    test1.yaml
    test2.yaml
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Single Test File for All Policies**:
   - You can create a single test file (`test.yaml`) that references multiple policies in the same test definition. 

2. **Multiple Test Files**:
   - You can create separate test files (`test1.yaml`, `test2.yaml`) for different policies and run them iteratively in the job.

---

### Example Job YAML for Single Test File
If you have one test file (`test.yaml`) that tests all policies, you can structure the job like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kyverno-test-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kyverno-cli
        image: <your_registry>/kyverno-cli:latest
        command: ["/usr/local/bin/kyverno"]
        args:
        - "test"
        - "/policies"
        - "--source"
        - "/tests/test.yaml"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: policy-volume
          mountPath: /policies
        - name: test-volume
          mountPath: /tests
      volumes:
      - name: policy-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /your-application/policies
      - name: test-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /your-application/tests
      restartPolicy: Never
```

- **Policies**: All policies from `/policies` are automatically included.
- **Tests**: The single `test.yaml` file in `/tests` tests all policies.

---

### Example Job YAML for Multiple Test Files
If you have multiple test files and want the job to run all tests sequentially, you can use a script:

#### Job YAML with Script

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kyverno-test-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kyverno-cli
        image: <your_registry>/kyverno-cli:latest
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
        - |
          for test_file in /tests/*.yaml; do
            echo "Running tests from $test_file"
            kyverno test /policies --source $test_file || exit 1
          done
        volumeMounts:
        - name: policy-volume
          mountPath: /policies
        - name: test-volume
          mountPath: /tests
      volumes:
      - name: policy-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /your-application/policies
      - name: test-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /your-application/tests
      restartPolicy: Never
```

#### Explanation
1. **Script to Loop Through Test Files**:
   - The `for` loop in the `args` iterates through all YAML files in `/tests/`.
   - For each test file, it runs `kyverno test` with all policies in `/policies`.

2. **Failure Handling**:
   - If a test fails, the job exits with a non-zero code (`exit 1`), causing the job to fail.

---

### Key Points
- **Single Test File**: Easier to manage but can become large if there are many scenarios for different policies.
- **Multiple Test Files**: More modular, allows you to organize tests specific to each policy, but requires a script to iterate through them.

---

### Testing Locally
To validate your setup locally, you can run:

```bash
# Single test file
kyverno test /path/to/policies --source /path/to/tests/test.yaml

# Multiple test files
for test_file in /path/to/tests/*.yaml; do
  kyverno test /path/to/policies --source $test_file
done
```
