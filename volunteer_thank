Subject: Thank You for Powering LEAP 2025

Dear [Name],

As we conclude LEAP 2025 Cohort 2 at the Bengaluru Tech Centre, I want to take a moment to thank you for the invaluable role you played in shaping and delivering this program.

From brainstorming the right sessions and identifying impactful speakers, to supporting logistics, mentoring project teams, and ensuring smooth execution across all five days, 
your contributions went far beyond tasks, they directly shaped the participant experience. 
Because of your commitment, the participants were able to fully immerse themselves in the program, learn without distraction, and 
take away lessons that will continue to influence their careers and teams.

What makes your involvement even more meaningful is that, as a LEAP alumnus, you’ve chosen to give back to the very community that once shaped your own journey.
By paying it forward, you not only helped this cohort grow—you strengthened the cycle of leadership, collaboration, and continuous learning that defines LEAP.

The success of LEAP rests on the passion and ownership of volunteers like you. You didn’t just support the program, you elevated it, 
creating an environment where participants could learn, collaborate, and grow with confidence.


On behalf of the Professional Development workstream, I’d also like to extend our thanks to your manager for supporting your involvement. 
Contributions like yours not only strengthen LEAP but also help us build a culture of continuous learning and leadership across the Tech Centre.

Warm regards,
