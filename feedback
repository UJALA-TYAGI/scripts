Expert Engineer Panel

Hi Sudeepto and Raju,

As we wrap up Day 3 of LEAP Cohort-1 at the Bengaluru Tech Centre, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks for joining us on the Expert Engineer Panel and sharing your inspiring journeys with our participants.

Your session struck a perfect balance between fun and insight—from the light-hearted questions at the start to the deeply reflective discussions that followed. By walking us through your experience in the Expert Engineer program, you gave our future leaders a clear picture of how technical growth and leadership go hand in hand.

Your openness about receiving developmental feedback positively, the importance of soft skills in today’s environment, and how to carve out a meaningful path in the firm resonated strongly with the group. The concluding Q&A was especially impactful, with many participants taking away practical advice they could immediately apply.

Thank you both for making time to contribute to this program. Your presence and insights not only added tremendous value to the day but also helped inspire the next generation of tech leaders at JPMorgan Chase.

Warm regards,
LEAP India Core Team

Hi Mridula, 

As Day 4 of LEAP 2025 Cohort -1 at Bengaluru Tech Center draws to a close, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks for the incredible session you delivered on “Improv Your Network.”  Your session was engaging, high-energy, and packed with insights—it struck a perfect balance between learning and real-time application, leaving a lasting impression on the cohort.

Your unique approach to highlighting the intersection between improvisation and effective communication offered our participants a fresh and practical perspective on networking. By breaking down what improv truly means—being present, actively listening, building on others’ ideas—you empowered the cohort with tools to communicate more authentically and confidently in dynamic, unscripted settings.

The real-time activities gave participants a chance to immediately apply the principles of improv, pushing them to think on their feet, respond with empathy, and connect more meaningfully. The energy, spontaneity, and inclusivity you brought into the session created a vibrant learning environment that was both fun and deeply reflective.

We’d also like to thank your manager for supporting your involvement in firmwide professional development programs like LEAP. Your contribution plays a meaningful role in shaping the communication and leadership capabilities of our future tech leaders.

Thank you once again for sharing your time, insights, and enthusiasm with us.


Warm Regards, Leap India Core Team
