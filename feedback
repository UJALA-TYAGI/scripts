Expert Engineer Panel

Hi Sudeepto and Raju,

As we wrap up Day 3 of LEAP Cohort-1 at the Bengaluru Tech Centre, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks for joining us on the Expert Engineer Panel and sharing your inspiring journeys with our participants.

Your session struck a perfect balance between fun and insight—from the light-hearted questions at the start to the deeply reflective discussions that followed. By walking us through your experience in the Expert Engineer program, you gave our future leaders a clear picture of how technical growth and leadership go hand in hand.

Your openness about receiving developmental feedback positively, the importance of soft skills in today’s environment, and how to carve out a meaningful path in the firm resonated strongly with the group. The concluding Q&A was especially impactful, with many participants taking away practical advice they could immediately apply.

Thank you both for making time to contribute to this program. Your presence and insights not only added tremendous value to the day but also helped inspire the next generation of tech leaders at JPMorgan Chase.

Warm regards,
LEAP India Core Team
