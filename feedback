Expert Engineer Panel

Hi Sudeepto and Raju,

As we wrap up Day 3 of LEAP Cohort-1 at the Bengaluru Tech Centre, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks for joining us on the Expert Engineer Panel and sharing your inspiring journeys with our participants.

Your session struck a perfect balance between fun and insight—from the light-hearted questions at the start to the deeply reflective discussions that followed. By walking us through your experience in the Expert Engineer program, you gave our future leaders a clear picture of how technical growth and leadership go hand in hand.

Your openness about receiving developmental feedback positively, the importance of soft skills in today’s environment, and how to carve out a meaningful path in the firm resonated strongly with the group. The concluding Q&A was especially impactful, with many participants taking away practical advice they could immediately apply.

Thank you both for making time to contribute to this program. Your presence and insights not only added tremendous value to the day but also helped inspire the next generation of tech leaders at JPMorgan Chase.

Warm regards,
LEAP India Core Team

Hi Mridula, 

As Day 4 of LEAP 2025 Cohort -1 at Bengaluru Tech Center draws to a close, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks for the incredible session you delivered on “Improv Your Network.”  Your session was engaging, high-energy, and packed with insights—it struck a perfect balance between learning and real-time application, leaving a lasting impression on the cohort.

Your unique approach to highlighting the intersection between improvisation and effective communication offered our participants a fresh and practical perspective on networking. By breaking down what improv truly means—being present, actively listening, building on others’ ideas—you empowered the cohort with tools to communicate more authentically and confidently in dynamic, unscripted settings.

The real-time activities gave participants a chance to immediately apply the principles of improv, pushing them to think on their feet, respond with empathy, and connect more meaningfully. The energy, spontaneity, and inclusivity you brought into the session created a vibrant learning environment that was both fun and deeply reflective.

We’d also like to thank your manager for supporting your involvement in firmwide professional development programs like LEAP. Your contribution plays a meaningful role in shaping the communication and leadership capabilities of our future tech leaders.

Thank you once again for sharing your time, insights, and enthusiasm with us.

Hi Shaleen,

As we wrap up Day 4 of LEAP 2025 Cohort-1 at the Bengaluru Tech Center, we want to extend our sincere thanks for delivering such a thought-provoking and empowering session on Personal Branding.
Your session challenged participants to reflect on their core strengths, unique value, and the legacy they wish to build. By asking powerful questions like “What do you want to be known for?” and “What makes you stand out?”, you encouraged the cohort to look inward and start shaping their own narrative with clarity and intention.
The “DATA” framework you introduced—Desires, Abilities, Temperament, and Assets—provided a practical blueprint for participants to begin defining their personal brand. The way you broke down each element and tied it to real-world relevance made the concept not just accessible but actionable.
Your explanation of how reputation = skills + habits was both simple and impactful, helping participants understand the importance of consistency and intentionality in how they present themselves across teams and the organization.
Thank you once again for sharing your time and experience with us. Your insights are sure to leave a lasting impression on the cohort as they work toward becoming more self-aware, purpose-driven professionals.
We’d also like to thank your manager for supporting your involvement in firmwide development initiatives like LEAP. Contributions like yours play a vital role in nurturing our future leaders.

Hi Ankur,
Thank you for delivering a highly insightful and engaging session on IP & Whitepapers as part of LEAP 2025 Cohort-1 at the Bengaluru Tech Centre.
Your distinction between innovation and invention set a thoughtful foundation for the discussion, especially as you introduced the 4Ps of Innovation—Paradigm, Process, Position, and Product—which helped participants contextualize innovation beyond traditional boundaries.
Your walkthrough of the LEAN problem-solving method, inspired by Lean Startup by Eric Ries, was particularly impactful. The accompanying hands-on activity around the Lean Canvas gave the cohort an opportunity to apply structured thinking to real-world challenges, bridging theory with practice.
The session also demystified the concepts of patents and whitepapers, clarifying their strategic importance in the innovation journey. Your clear breakdown of different patent types and the process of articulating value through whitepapers added practical value for our participants looking to contribute more meaningfully to intellectual property at the firm.
Thank you once again for sharing your time, experience, and knowledge with us. Sessions like yours play an important role in equipping our future tech leaders with the mindset and tools to innovate with intent and structure.
Warm regards, LEAP India Core Team
