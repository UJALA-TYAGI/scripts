Hello everyone, we are the team bruteForce. My name is Ujala, I have Ritesh, Krishna, and Deepa with me. We have prajwal from Bengaluru and Satyabati, shiny an dteena joining from Mumbai.
And here we are with our product, ConfigAI, an AI Agents Agency.
Let me guess what you're thinking: 'Oh great, another AI project, more Gen AI talk, and the usual 'we're doing this and that.' But fear not! We're not here to bore you with the same old story. Instead, we have a couple of questions for you: Do you trust AI? And do you trust AI agents the same way you trust human developers?  Well I expected that! Concerns about AI reliability and transparency are real, impacting user trust and adoption.  Now, let's shift gears a bit. Imagine you're embarking on a software development journey. But wait, don't groan yet – this isn't the usual saga of late nights and endless debugging. Picture this: a world where your code practically writes itself, documentation is always pristine, and deployments are as uneventful as a lazy Sunday afternoon. Sounds like a dream, right? Welcome to the future of software development with ConfigAI!
ConfigAI replicates developer roles seamlessly in a scrum team setup. We have AI agents as product owners, scrum masters, senior developers, and juniors, all collaborating efficiently.

Okay, I know I said I wouldn't bore you with the 'we're doing this and that,' but I couldn't help myself – it's just too exciting! And guess what? The fun is only beginning. So, back to those burning questions: Would you trust AI agents over human developers? Buckle up, because the answer might just blow your mind!"

At JPMC, transparency and reliability are at the heart of our hearts. When we talk about trust, it's not just a buzzword. Our AI agents log every conversation, capturing the rationale behind each decision and how problems are solved. This level of detailed logging provides unmatched transparency, ensuring you always know what's happening under the hood.
Our AI agents continuously learn and evolve, much like human developers, but without the burnout. For example, just as a senior software developer's journey is marked by growth and learning, our AI agents' progress is meticulously documented. They hone their skills based on a reward system, allowing you to track their journey from junior to senior developer, and see how their expertise has been refined over time.
We also believe in cost transparency. Every API call, every conversation between agents, and every action taken is documented with its associated cost. This ensures you have a clear, upfront understanding of expenses, just as you would with human developers.
In short, ConfigAI mirrors the trust and transparency you expect from industry professionals. Our AI agents are not only reliable and efficient but also provide a clear, accountable, and cost-effective solution for your software development needs.

With ConfigAI, human developers have an invaluable partner in pair programming. This dynamic duo isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about transformation.

Our SEPs will benefit tremendously by pairing with AI agents that match the skills of senior developers. They will gain hands-on experience and practical knowledge in real-time, without waiting on the availability of a human mentor. This will not only accelerates their learning curve but also frees up senior developers for more strategic tasks.

Moreover, pairing with AI agents provides a significant psychological advantage. Engineers can learn and experiment without the fear of judgment, creating a supportive environment conducive to growth and innovation. It’s like having a mentor who’s always patient, always available, and always focused on helping them succeed. It’s more than just automation; it’s about empowering developers to excel and innovate without limits.

Now before we move ahead with the demo, let’s get one thing straight: we're not just another AI tool on the market. We're the upgrade you've been waiting for. Imagine comparing a flip phone to a smartphone – that's us versus the other AI tools out there.

For the conclusion, I just want to say that, Trust in our transparency, rely on our efficiency, and experience a revolutionary approach to software development with ConfigAI. Let’s make your development process not only seamless but extraordinary!
Thank you for your time.
