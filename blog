LEAP 2025 Cohort 1: Developing the Next Generation of Technology Leaders
The Leadership and Engineering Advancement Program (LEAP) continues to serve as one of the most impactful learning experiences within Global Technology. Held at the Bengaluru Tech Centre, the latest cohort brought together 42 high-performing associates for a five-day, in-person journey focused on developing professional, technical, and leadership capabilities.
Designed for 602-level technologists, LEAP 2025 Cohort 1 provided participants with a structured yet dynamic environment to reflect, build, and apply critical leadership skills within a technical context. With a carefully curated curriculum, the program balanced interactive workshops, business-aligned discussions, and experiential learning — all aimed at building the capabilities needed to thrive in high-impact roles.
Over the course of the week, participants engaged in sessions that emphasized clarity in communication, the power of emotional intelligence, the importance of sustainability in technology, and the mindset required for innovation. Beyond classroom learning, they worked in cross-functional teams to address real-world problem statements, applying the tools and frameworks they were exposed to throughout the program.
Each day was anchored by expert facilitators, senior leaders, and alumni who shared their insights and experiences, reinforcing the firm’s commitment to developing talent at every level. The program culminated in a capstone presentation, where teams showcased their learnings through well-structured, business-oriented proposals in front of an evaluation panel.
LEAP’s unique model — centrally designed, but locally delivered — ensures global consistency while empowering tech centers like Bengaluru to adapt content to their needs. It’s this balance that allows LEAP to remain highly relevant and effective year after year.
With this cohort, over 2,600 technologists have now completed LEAP globally — a growing network of professionals equipped to lead with purpose, influence with clarity, and contribute meaningfully to the firm’s future.

LEAP continues to be one of the most distinctive leadership acceleration experiences offered across Global Technology. The recently concluded LEAP 2025 – Cohort 1, hosted at the Bengaluru Tech Centre, brought together 42 high-performing associates for an intensive five-day journey of self-development, collaboration, and applied learning.

Participants spent the week engaging in interactive sessions, peer learning, and hands-on collaboration. They tackled complex business problems, received direct feedback, and reflected on how they show up — as individuals, as teammates, and as technologists.
The capstone of the program was a final team presentation, where participants applied their learnings to real-world business challenges, presenting structured, strategic solutions to a panel of evaluators. These moments served not only to demonstrate growth but to celebrate the clarity and confidence that emerged through the week.
What sets LEAP apart is not just the content — but the community. Facilitated by program alumni and supported by leaders and mentors across levels, the experience is rooted in shared purpose and lasting connections.
As LEAP 2025 Cohort 1 concludes, these 42 participants join a global alumni network of over 2,600 technologists — each equipped to lead with empathy, drive meaningful change, and contribute to a culture of continuous learning across JPMorgan Chase.


LEAP 2025 Cohort 1: More Than a Program—A Transformation
What does it take to become a leader in today’s fast-changing tech landscape? At JPMorgan Chase, we believe leadership isn’t just about titles or technical skills—it’s about mindset, curiosity, and connection. This belief was at the heart of LEAP 2025 Cohort 1, a five-day immersive experience hosted at the Bengaluru Tech Centre that brought together 42 talented associates ready to take the next step in their careers.
From day one, LEAP challenged participants to look beyond their usual routines. It wasn’t about sitting through lectures—it was about engaging in real conversations, tackling tough questions, and reflecting on how they show up as professionals and people.
The week was filled with dynamic workshops and collaborative problem-solving. Participants explored how to shape their personal brand with intention, communicate authentically through improv, and ask questions that spark insight and empathy. They connected the dots between emotional intelligence, storytelling, and innovation, all while learning to think and lead with impact.
But LEAP isn’t just about skills—it’s about perspective. It invites participants to pause, reset, and consider how they can influence not only their own growth but the success of their teams and the wider organization.
The program culminated in team presentations, where fresh ideas and newfound confidence came together. These moments weren’t just about sharing solutions—they were celebrations of growth, resilience, and collaboration.
What truly sets LEAP apart is its community. Guided by passionate facilitators—many of whom are LEAP alumni—participants become part of a global network of more than 2,600 professionals committed to learning, mentoring, and leading across JPMorgan Chase.
As LEAP 2025 Cohort 1 concludes, these technologists aren’t just stepping forward—they’re leaping ahead, equipped with the tools, mindset, and connections to make a meaningful difference.
