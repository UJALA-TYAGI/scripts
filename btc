Some events you attend — others, you feel. The ones that stick with you are the ones where you leave knowing you were seen for who you are. That’s what DE&I is all about.

Hi everyone! I’m Ujala, I work on Atlas2 in IP, and I was part of the Engineering Committee for 2023. Being part of the committee gave me a front-row seat to everything this place has to offer — and how much we can all gain from it.


One of my favorite experiences was Pride to Be. This event made a statement — your identity matters here, and you don’t need to hide any part of yourself. We invited students from top uni who had come out to the world — and honestly, it was such a vibe. We had games, fun activities, and some really meaningful conversations about identity and acceptance. We showed them that this is a place where everyone can show up as their authentic selves. The energy, the conversations — it made me feel proud to be part of a firm that actively creates that kind of space.

Then there was Canvas — a five-day marathon of energy and celebration! What made it special was how naturally it brought people together and created a real sense of connection. We had workshops and engaging events happening all day, every day. And the grand finale? That was pure chaos in the best way — flash mobs, music jams, dhol — it felt like a festival!
I still remember Deepak Mitra, our BTC manager, playing the drums for the crowd — the energy was electric, and the feeling was just ecstatic. I even danced with senior leaders from my team, including Anita Mary from IP, and with people I had never spoken to before. That moment itself was special — it felt like I was part of something bigger, part of a firm that truly celebrates its people in the most authentic way. And the food — the sheer variety from all corners of the country — was absolutely mouth-watering.
It was loud, energetic, and absolutely perfect. We celebrated everyone who is part of this tech centre, and that’s what made it unforgettable.

What I’ve learned through these experiences is that
The goal isn’t to make certain groups feel comfortable - it’s to build a culture where nobody feels like an outsider.  
So as you start your journey here, lean into it. Join the events, have the conversations — and most importantly, just be yourself.  Because you’re meant to be here.
Thank you!
