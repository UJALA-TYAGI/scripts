We are closing the current Jira ticket as we have identified a more efficient strategy for scanning our container images. We will implement separate pipelines for our deployment images and Kyverno dependency images to optimize the use of our limited kaniko pods and decrease build times. Building all images together would be time-consuming, so having two pipelines allows us to build Kyverno images only when there is an upgrade. This approach will save both time and resources. We will create linked spikes to continue working on these tasks in a streamlined manner.


This approach will ensure thorough and effective scanning. We will create linked spikes to continue working on these tasks in a streamlined manner.
