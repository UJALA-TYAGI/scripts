Four days ago, we all boarded a train.
Not a real one—with tracks or stations—but one that moved fast, asked tough questions, made unexpected stops, and handed no return tickets.

At first, we looked around, unsure—wondering who we’d be sitting next to, where we were going, and whether we packed the right “skills” for the journey.

Then the train started moving.
It began with a gentle jolt—asking us to pause and ask: What do I want to be known for?
We looked inside—at our desires, abilities, temperament, and assets—and began building something more intentional: our personal brand.

Then came the tunnels—where we had to communicate without a script, think on our feet, and truly listen. Improv wasn’t just an activity. It became a mindset.

Somewhere along the way, someone raised a hand—not just to ask a question, but to ask a powerful question. And that opened up a whole new track. One that led to emotional intelligence, to understanding the stakeholders we travel with, and the stories we tell to move a room.

And just when we thought we were cruising, came a curve—innovation. What it is. What it’s not. And how we can solve problems not by guessing, but by observing, testing, learning.

Now, here we are—at the final stop of this ride. But you’ve changed.
You’ve grown.
You’ve connected dots you didn’t even know were on the map four days ago.

And today? You get to step off this train—not as passengers, but as navigators. Ready to chart the next journey, tell the next story, and take the leap.



Now, for those of you who haven’t met me over chai, I’m Ujala Tyagi, SEP from 2023 batch working on atlas2, CFS IP.



Now, LEAP isn’t just about the sessions or the structure—it’s about the people who pour their heart into making it what it is.

And one of those people is someone I’ve had the pleasure of working alongside—not just this week, but across several initiatives that shape the Bengaluru Tech Center experience.

A leader in the making, a familiar face to many of you, and someone who's just as passionate about creating spaces like these as all of you are about being in them—
Ikshul, over to you.
