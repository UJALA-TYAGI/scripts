Hello everyone,

Iâ€™m thrilled to be here as your new EC lead to discuss our initiatives and future plans, particularly focusing on Early Talent and our efforts to foster connectivity and development within our community.

Early Talent refers to the pool of individuals who have joined our firm in recent years, encompassing both fresh graduates and experienced hires. Our aim is to integrate this diverse group seamlessly into our organization, providing them with the support and opportunities they need to thrive.

In my role as EC lead, I've had the privilege of overseeing various initiatives aimed at enhancing our members' experiences. This role has been incredibly beneficial for me personally, helping me network more effectively with colleagues and senior leaders alike. Organizing different events has allowed me to make a significant impact within our community, and I am eager to continue this journey.

Let me highlight some of the events we've successfully organized so far. Our SEP Connect event was a major success, helping SEPs learn about the various committees within JPMC that they could join based on their interests. We also hosted a panel discussion on "How to Leap Towards Early Promotion," featuring individuals who transitioned from SEPs to early promotions, offering valuable insights and guidance.

Looking ahead, we have several exciting plans. Our next major event is the MD Connect, which we are hosting in a TEDx style for over 1,000 technologists across BTC. MDs will share their insights on various topics, creating a dynamic and inspiring atmosphere. Additionally, we are organizing volunteering and sports events specifically for SEPs, promoting teamwork, wellness, and community engagement.

In closing, I want to emphasize the importance of these initiatives in building a cohesive, supportive, and vibrant community. By participating in these events, we can all contribute to a more connected and empowered organization. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to working with all of you to make these plans a reality.

Thank you.
