To set up an alert for changes in the log level in Envoy, you'll need to implement a monitoring and alerting system that can detect changes in the configuration or log level and then send an email notification. Hereâ€™s a high-level approach on how to achieve this:

### 1. **Monitoring Configuration Changes**

#### Option A: Using a Configuration Management System
If you are using a configuration management system (like Kubernetes, Ansible, or a CI/CD pipeline), you can set up a trigger to monitor changes in the Envoy configuration file (`envoy.yaml`). When a change is detected, the system can send an alert.

#### Option B: Using a File Watcher
You can use a file-watching tool (like `inotify` on Linux) to monitor changes to the `envoy.yaml` file.

### 2. **Detecting Log Level Changes**

You can look for changes specifically in the log level configuration by parsing the `envoy.yaml` file or monitoring the logs for log level change messages.

### 3. **Sending Email Notifications**

You can use tools like `sendmail`, `Postfix`, or external services like SendGrid, AWS SES, or a simple SMTP server to send email notifications.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Setting Up File Watcher (Example using `inotify` on Linux)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

CONFIG_FILE="/path/to/envoy.yaml"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/envoy_config_changes.log"
EMAIL="your-email@example.com"

inotifywait -m -e modify "$CONFIG_FILE" | while read path _ file; do
    echo "$(date): $file modified" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    if grep -q 'log_level' "$CONFIG_FILE"; then
        echo "Log level changed in $file" | mail -s "Envoy Log Level Change Alert" "$EMAIL"
    fi
done
```
- Save this script as `watch_envoy_config.sh` and run it in the background.

#### Step 2: Using a Configuration Management Tool
If you are using Kubernetes, you can use an `initContainer` or a sidecar container to watch the configuration file and send alerts on changes.

#### Step 3: Using Monitoring Tools
You can use monitoring tools like Prometheus with an Alertmanager to send alerts. Here is a basic example of how you might do this with Prometheus:

- **Prometheus Configuration (`prometheus.yml`)**
  ```yaml
  global:
    scrape_interval: 15s
    evaluation_interval: 15s

  rule_files:
    - "alert_rules.yml"

  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'envoy'
      static_configs:
        - targets: ['127.0.0.1:9901']  # Envoy admin interface
  ```

- **Alert Rules (`alert_rules.yml`)**
  ```yaml
  groups:
    - name: envoy_alerts
      rules:
        - alert: EnvoyLogLevelChanged
          expr: changes(envoy_config_hash) > 0
          for: 1m
          labels:
            severity: critical
          annotations:
            summary: "Envoy log level changed"
            description: "Log level has been changed in the Envoy configuration."
  ```

- **Alertmanager Configuration (`alertmanager.yml`)**
  ```yaml
  global:
    smtp_smarthost: 'smtp.example.com:587'
    smtp_from: 'alertmanager@example.com'
    smtp_auth_username: 'username'
    smtp_auth_password: 'password'

  route:
    receiver: 'email'

  receivers:
    - name: 'email'
      email_configs:
        - to: 'your-email@example.com'
          send_resolved: true
  ```

### Summary
1. **Set up a file watcher** to monitor changes to the Envoy configuration file.
2. **Detect log level changes** by parsing the configuration file or monitoring Envoy logs.
3. **Send email notifications** using a mail utility or service when a change is detected.

This provides a comprehensive way to monitor and alert on configuration changes, including log level changes in Envoy.
