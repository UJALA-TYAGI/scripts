Objective: Each team member contributes a personal symbol, drawing, or word that represents them, and these are brought together to form a shared identity for the program.
How to execute:
Provide everyone with a small canvas, card, or piece of fabric where they can design their personal contribution (using colors, symbols, or words that reflect their values or aspirations).
All individual pieces are then combined to form a larger artwork that represents the diverse identities and talents within the group.
Twist: The larger artwork could form the shape of the firm's logo, or a symbolic representation of teamwork and collaboration.
Outcome: A piece that reflects the diversity and individuality within the team, but also the unity of working toward a common goal.
